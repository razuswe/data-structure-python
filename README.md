# data-structure-python
This repository contains some data structures implementation in python programming language.

## Data Structures List:
### Linear Data Structure:
* Stack - Basic Implementation
* Stack - Parentheses Balance Checking
* Queue - Basic Implementation
* Conversion of Infix to Postfix notation. Evaluation of Postfix notation
* qeque – Double-Ended Queue
* Singly Linked List: Create, Print and Count the Item
* Singly Linked List: Create, Insert, Search, Delete and Print operation
* Doubly Linked List: Insert, Print the list forward and reverse order
* Doubly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Print the list forward and reverse order
* Circular Singly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Traverse (Print)
* Circular Doubly Linked List: Insert, Delete, Traverse (print) Forward order and Reverse order
### Non-Linear Data Structure:
* Tree - Binary Search Tree - BST [Insert, Search and Traversal]
* Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Find Maximum and Minimum value]
* Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Delete any node of BST]
* Tree – Binary Search Tree – BST [Checking: Is it a BST or Not?]
